        <h1>Nano Defender</h1>
        <p>An anti-adblock defuser for Nano Adblocker and uBlock Origin</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <p>Nano Defender can only protect <strong>either</strong> <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore#nano-adblocker-core" target="_blank">Nano Adblocker</a> or uBlock Origin, and will prioritize Nano Adblocker.</p>
        <br />

        <br />

        <p>Maintainers wanted for other browsers (open an issue to let me know).</p>
        <p>If you are using uBlock Origin, there are a few <a href="#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">extra installation steps</a> to follow.</p>

    <div class="container" id="announcements">
        <h2>Announcements</h2>

        <h4>May 5, 2018</h4>
        <p>Some solutions require Chrome or Chromium 66 or higher to work, make sure to update your browser.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>September 19, 2017</h4>
        <p>Nano Defender is <strong>100% free</strong>, and I do <strong>not</strong> accept donation. <strong>Now and in the future.</strong> My GitHub ID is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab ID is <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>jspenguin.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed by someone who is pretending to be a developer of Nano Defender.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
        <p>Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting Flash support are now low priority.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="troubleshooting">
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>Do you have proper <strong>regional filters</strong> activated?</p>
        <p>Are your filters up to date?</p>
        <p>Is Nano Defender up to date?</p>
        <p>Have you tried clearing your cookies?</p>
        <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Did you change any settings that may cause your adblocker to misbehave?</p>
        <p>If you are using uBlock Origin, did you properly follow the <a href="#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">extra installation steps</a>?</p>
        <p>Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AAK-Cont, or uBO-Extra? Nano Defender does similar things as they do which can lead to conflicts.</p>
        <p>Are you using more than one adblocker? Nano Defender can only protect one adblocker and will prioritize Nano Adblocker.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="common-questions-and-issues">
        <h2>Common questions and issues</h2>

        <p><strong>Will there be a configurable whitelist for Nano Defender?</strong></p>
        <p>Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a limitation of browser APIs.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Can console messages be turned off?</strong></p>
        <p>No, I need to see the console output on your end to quickly find the cause of your issues, that is why I ask for a screenshot of the console when you open an issue.</p>
        <p>In production mode, all the console messages will begin with <code>[Nano]</code>, so you can easily filter them out.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Can mining wall be bypassed?</strong></p>
        <p>No, that is not possible if the implementation on the server side is correct.</p>
        <p>Adblockers block mining scripts by default and I will not add exceptions if the mining process is started automatically.</p>
        <p>The control is in your hand, whitelist the page if you absolutely need the resources locked behind the wall.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Nano Defender is causing (further) breakage.</strong></p>
        <p><a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website freezes with Nano Defender enabled.</strong></p>
        <p>Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect Nano Defender, it could also be caused by a bug in Nano Defender.</p>
        <p>Either way, <a href="#reporting-an-issue">report it</a> and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to freezings <strong>caused</strong> by Nano Defender, other freezings may not be fixed this fast.</p>
        <p>On Chrome or Chromium, you can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>, select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website is still detecting my adblocker.</strong></p>
        <p>Nano Defender is not magical, a lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. <a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will have a look. Depending on the website, it can take some time.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website is perceptibly slower with Nano Defender enabled.</strong></p>
        <p><a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will have a look.</p>

        <h2>Reporting an issue</h2>
        <p><strong>Must read:</strong> The version of uBlock Origin that Nano Adblocker uses can be found in About section of Nano Dashboard. I am aware that Nano Adblocker is different, but when it comes to filters, most of the times things work the same. If you have been told by contributors of uAssets that your issue could not be reproduced, <strong>ping @jspenguin2017</strong> or report it again to <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters/issues" target="_blank">NanoFilters</a>.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Before opening an issue, <strong>always</strong> check <a href="#known-issues">known issues</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are using Edge, report all issues to <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters/issues" target="_blank">NanoFilters</a>.</p>
        <br />

        <p>For missed ads and tracking scripts, report to <a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/issues" target="_blank">EasyList</a>.</p>

    <div class="container" id="extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">
        <h2>Extra installation steps for uBlock Origin</h2>

        <p>Step 1. Enable <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Feasylist-downloads.adblockplus.org%2Fantiadblockfilters.txt&title=Adblock%20Warning%20Removal%20List">Adblock Warning Removal List</a>.</p>
        <p>Step 2. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FNanoFilters%2Fmaster%2FNanoMirror%2FNanoDefender.txt&title=Nano%20Defender%20Integration">Nano Defender Integration</a> filter list.</p>
        <p>Step 3. Go to uBlock Origin dashboard, select "Settings" tab, check "I am an advanced user", click the gears that shows up, <strong>replace</strong> "unset" after "userResourcesLocation" by "https://cdn.rawgit.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters/master/NanoFilters/NanoResources.txt" (without quotes).</p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> If you have another User Resources in use, then you would need to either switch to Nano Adblocker or manually merge resources. It takes an eternity to get any resources into uAssets, I have tried.</p>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The resource file is not a filter list, do not load it as a filter list or things will break.</p>
        <p>Step 4. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FNanoFilters%2Fmaster%2FNanoFilters%2FNanoBase.txt&title=Nano%20filters">Nano filters</a>.</p>
        <p>Step 5. Install <a href="ubo://subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2FNanoAdblocker%2FNanoFilters%2Fmaster%2FNanoFilters%2FNanoWhitelist.txt&title=Nano%20filters%20-%20Whitelist">Nano filters - Whitelist</a>.</p>
