        <h2>Announcements</h2>

        <h4>August 12, 2019</h4>
        <p>The embedded uBO-Extra code has been temporarily disabled as we received multiple reports that it is causing breakage. We are still investigating the root cause.</p>

        <h4>October 20, 2018</h4>
        <p>The subscription links for uBlock Origin were updated on October 20, 2018. If you are using uBlock Origin and subscribed before that date, you need to update your subscription as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Right click the uBlock Origin extension icon and click <code>Options</code></p>
        <p>2. Click the <code>Filter lists</code> tab</p>
        <p>3. Scroll to the bottom and click the red trash can for all filter lists subscribed from <code>cdn.rawgit.com</code> or <code>jspenguin.com</code></p>
        <p>4. Click the <code>Settings</code> tab</p>
        <p>5. Click the gears near the <code>I am an advanced user</code> option</p>
        <p>6. If <code>userResourcesLocation</code> is subscribed from <code>cdn.rawgit.com</code> or <code>jspenguin.com</code>, change it to <code>unset</code></p>
        <p>7. Click <a href="#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">here</a> to subscribe to the new links</p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> The subscription links will automatically update for Nano Adblocker.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>September 19, 2017</h4>
        <p>Nano Defender is 100% free, and I do not accept donation, now and in the future. My GitHub username is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab username is <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>hugoxu.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed by someone who is pretending to be a developer of Nano Defender.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
        <p>Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting Flash support are now low priority.</p>

    <div class="container" id="troubleshooting">
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <p>Be sure to review the <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters#filters-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filters policy</a> to know what are considered to be issues and what are not.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Do you have proper <strong>regional filters</strong> activated?</p>
        <p>Are your filters up to date?</p>
        <p>Is Nano Defender installed and up to date?</p>
        <p>Have you tried clearing your cookies?</p>
        <p>Have you tried clearing your cache and LocalStorage?</p>
        <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Did you change any settings that may cause your adblocker to misbehave?</p>
        <p>If you are using uBlock Origin, did you properly follow the <a href="#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">extra installation steps</a>?</p>
        <p>Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AAK-Cont, or uBO-Extra? Nano Defender does similar things as they do which can lead to conflicts.</p>
        <p>Are you using more than one adblocker? <strong>Nano Defender can only protect one adblocker</strong> and will prioritize Nano Adblocker.</p>

        <br />
        <p><i>Note:</i> I have received a few reports about the <code>ABP X Files</code> filter list causing issues, try disabling that filter list if you run into them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="common-questions-and-issues">
        <h2>Common questions and issues</h2>

        <p><strong>Will there be a configurable whitelist for Nano Defender?</strong></p>
        <p>Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a limitation of browser APIs.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Can console messages be turned off?</strong></p>
        <p>No, I need to see the console output on your end to quickly find the cause of your issues, that is why I ask for a screenshot of the console when you open an issue.</p>
        <p>In production mode, all the console messages will begin with <code>[Nano]</code>, so you can easily filter them out with <code>-[Nano]</code>.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Can mining wall be bypassed?</strong></p>
        <p>No, that is not possible if the implementation on the server side is correct.</p>
        <p>Adblockers block mining scripts by default and I will not add exceptions if the mining process is started automatically.</p>
        <p>Whitelist the page if you want the resources locked behind the wall.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Nano Defender is causing (further) breakage.</strong></p>
        <p><a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage caused by Nano Defender, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website freezes with Nano Defender enabled.</strong></p>
        <p>Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect Nano Defender, it could also be caused by a bug in Nano Defender.</p>
        <p>Either way, <a href="#reporting-an-issue">report it</a> and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to freezings caused by Nano Defender, other freezings may not be fixed this fast.</p>
        <p>In Chrome or Chromium, you can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>, select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website is still detecting my adblocker.</strong></p>
        <p>Nano Defender is not magical. A lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. <a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will have a look. Depending on the website, it can take some time.</p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>A website is perceptibly slower with Nano Defender enabled.</strong></p>
        <p><a href="#reporting-an-issue">Report it</a> and I will have a look.</p>
