# Privacy Policy for Quick Issue Reporter

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to the Quick Issue Reporter
(the "Tool") published and distributed by @jspenguin2017 (the "Author").
The Author has little control over forks of the Tool so the Policy may
not apply to them. Furthermore, the Policy only applies to latest unmodified
production builds of the Tool.

The Tool allows you to quickly report issues related to Nano Adblocker and Nano
Defender (the "Projects") you encounter when browsing the Internet.

The Tool will only collect your data when you actively use it, and will not
connect to remote servers before the "Send" button is clicked.

By using the Tool, you consent to:
- The most recent version of the Policy,
- The [privacy policy of GeoJS](https://www.geojs.io/privacy/),
- The [privacy policy of MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/privacy-policy),
- The
  [privacy policy of GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement),
  and
- The [privacy policy of GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/)

### Data Collection and Usage

1. Your IP address
   - We may use GeoJS and/or MaxMind to process your IP address
   - You can use a VPN, but be sure the issue you are reporting can be
     reproduced while using your VPN
   - The country that your IP address belongs to and/or part of your IP address
     may be shared publicly
2. User agent string of your browser
   - Do not try to mask or change it; if the maintainers are unable to
     reproduce the issue, your report will be ignored
3. Version string of the Projects that you are using
4. The URL of the page where the Tool is opened
   - You are responsible in ensuring that you are not opening the Tool on a
     page where the URL is sensitive
5. The form that you have filled
   - If you supplied a test account in the form, that account will not be
     shared publicly (it may still be shared with a selected group of
     people)
     - Please note that although the Author will only select people he trusts
       to be part of the group, there is no guarantee of any sort
     - The Author takes no responsibility for the actions of other people in
       the group
   - You are responsible in ensuring information you entered into this form
     is not sensitive in nature and test accounts that you supplied contain
     only test data
     - Please refrain from submitting personally identifiable information

Collected data will be used to improve the Projects, as well as related
projects such as uAssets. Collected data may be shared with a selected group of
people or publicly unless otherwise indicated above.

### Data Deletion

By using the Tool, you are contributing to open source projects, and you may
not take back your contributions at a later date.

### Security Practices

The server acting as temporary storage is controlled by the Author and has
systems in place to prevent unauthorized access:
- Two Factor Authentication on Amazon Web Services root account
- Public key authentication for Secure Shell access
- Firewall with only necessary ports open
- Automatic HTTPS upgrade for production endpoints

Moderated reports are stored in GitHub and/or GitLab issues trackers.

Please note that although the Author is committed in keeping his server secure,
there is no guarantee of any sort. Like many other open source projects, the
Tool is delivered as-is and comes with absolutely no warranty.

### Alternative Solutions

You can report issues to respective issues trackers manually.

### Future Versions

The Policy may be modified at any time, with or without notice.
